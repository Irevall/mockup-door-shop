### Specification (all optional) I haven't done
- language by location (I'd use Google Geocoding free API plan if I had time to set it up)
- 3D view (hard to tell what it means from design alone)
- tests (not well experienced in testing)

### Things I could improve
- adjust styling to fit design better (altough it fits almost perfectly)
- better validation for width/height
- language selector dropdown
