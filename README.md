### Specification (all optional) I haven't done
- 3D view (hard to tell what it means from design alone)
- tests (I'm not well experienced in testing)

### Things I could improve with more time
- adjust styling to fit design better (altough it fits pretty well)
- organize repeating colors into variables
- language selector dropdown isn't as on Design
- my components (and BEM) started to get cluttered as I run out of time
- better validation for width/height
